# Bike-Rental-Analysis

A data-driven **bike rental demand analysis and prediction** project using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
This project explores historical bike rental data to identify usage patterns, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize key relationships, and build machine learning models to predict bike rental demand.

---

## 🚴 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand the factors that influence bike rental demand, such as **weather conditions, seasons, and time-based features**, and to build predictive models that estimate the number of bike rentals.

This analysis helps demonstrate practical skills in **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling**.

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends and patterns
- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Engineer meaningful features
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Analyze model performance using standard regression metrics

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis and correlation study
- Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Machine learning models for demand prediction
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² score
