# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Rental Analysis & Prediction

**A data-driven bike rental demand analysis and prediction project** deployed as an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://bike-rental-analysis-prashu.streamlit.app/

---

## 📌 Project Summary

This project explores historical bike rental data to uncover usage patterns and build predictive models that estimate bike rental demand. It showcases skills in **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, **visualization**, and **machine learning modeling**.

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to identify trends and insights  
- Clean and preprocess raw dataset  
- Engineer meaningful features  
- Build and evaluate Machine Learning models for prediction  
- Compare model performance using regression metrics

---

## 📈 Features

- 🔍 Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- 📊 Visualizations using **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**  
- 🤖 Machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
- 📉 Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and R² score  
- 🌐 Deployed interactive dashboard

## 🧠 Workflow

1. Load and inspect data  
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering  
4. Train and evaluate machine learning models  
5. Deploy the model with a Streamlit dashboard

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes historical bike rental information with key features such as:
- Date  
- Season  
- Weather conditions  
- Temperature and humidity  
- Rental count (target variable)

---

## 📌 Model Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate with:
- **R² Score**  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
